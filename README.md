Advent of Code 2019
===================

I recently came to know about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and thougth
should try it out. These are my solution for various problems provided.

### How to run this?
Programs are sorted by day. So, to execute for 5th day's input go to folder `5`.
Download the input in a file and pipe the input.

For example, your input is saved in `input.txt`. Run following command in terminal.

```
node 1.js < input.txt
```

### What all did I learn by this exercise?

I implemented following programs:
- An intcode execution module which is used across problems.
- Tree traversal
- Common ancestor of two nodes in a tree
- Distance between two nodes in a tree
- Intersection of edges in a graph
- All permutations of a string
